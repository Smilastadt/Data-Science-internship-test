Task 2: Sentinel-2 Image Matching with ORB
Project Structure

The project folder, named Task 2._Smilianets_Computer_vision, contains the following files:

ORB_for_Sentinel-2.py: Python script for keypoint detection and matching using the ORB algorithm.

Smilianets_Task2_demo.ipynb: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the keypoint matching algorithm using ORB.

requirements.txt: Text file listing all necessary Python modules and their versions.

Example image 1.jpg and Example image 2.jpg - images used as an example in the notebook

Setting Up the Project
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required Python modules installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Demo Script:
Execute the script ORB_for_Sentinel-2.py to open a console allowing you to interactively open images and visualize keypoint matches. Run the script using the following command:
python ORB_for_Sentinel-2.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to open images, match keypoints, and visualize the results.

Explore the Jupyter Notebook:
Open and explore the Jupyter notebook Smilianets_Task2_demo.ipynb for a detailed demonstration of the image matching algorithm. Execute the cells to load images, match keypoints, and visualize the results.

Note:
Ensure that the images used for demonstration are available in the project folder and provide the correct paths in the scripts when prompted.
If needed, update the paths or filenames in the scripts to match the actual file locations on your system.

Feel free to customize the scripts based on your specific requirements and dataset.

Now you're ready to explore and utilize the Sentinel-2 image matching functionality using the ORB algorithm in this project!
